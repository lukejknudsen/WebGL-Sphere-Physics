# WebGL-Sphere-Physics
 This project aims to take physics of point masses and apply them to spheres rendered in WebGL. The spheres are created from algorithmically generated triangles, and move with a given velocity and mass. This means that collisions can conserve momentum. Accelerations are also applied to the spheres, decreasing the velocity in each direction over time (air resistance) and applying a negative acceleration on the y axis (gravity). Acceleration values are applied to the velocity vector each frame, and velocity is applied to the translation vector in order to move the sphere in space the appropriate amount.
